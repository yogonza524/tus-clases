# Abstraction
Its main goal is to handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user. That enables the user to implement more complex logic on top of the provided abstraction without understanding or even thinking about all the hidden complexity.

That’s a very generic concept that’s not limited to object-oriented programming. You can find it everywhere in the real world.

Objects in an OOP language provide an abstraction that hides the internal implementation details. Similar to the coffee machine in your kitchen, you just need to know which methods of the object are available to call and which input parameters are needed to trigger a specific operation. But you don’t need to understand how this method is implemented and which kinds of actions it has to perform to create the expected result.

Let’s implement the coffee machine example in Java. You do the same in any other object-oriented programming language. The syntax might be a little bit different, but the general concept is the same.
